# Graphes et outils logiques (GOL)

This course is a second year course by [M.Thibaut Thibault](https://www.lri.fr/~blsk/GOL/. Students enrolled in the double major program should take this course in the first year.

This course mix aspects of mathematics and of algorithms. It has the objective to let the students discover the basic of fundemental data structures and  algorithms and to sharpen the students' capacity of mathematical reasoning.

In this project we will use python to modelise the labyrinthe using characters.
The second part consist of applying mathematical(equivalence relation) and algorithmic(Union-Find) aspects tackled during this course in order to solve the labyrinthe.

The explanation and the code are in french. It is not hard to understand though!
